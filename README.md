## Overview 
The No FEAR Act Matching Game is an interactive educational tool designed to help users learn and reinforce No FEAR Act concepts. Players flip cards to match No FEAR Act terms with their correct definitions/examples. The game is designed to provide feedback when a match is correct or incorrect and includes features such as a countdown timer, limited attempts, and restart functionality. This repository is the improvement of the already made matching game by a team from the previous semester. 

## Features
- Interactive Card Matching: Players flip cards to match terms with their correct definitions.
- Visual Feedback: Cards flash red for incorrect matches and green for correct ones.
- Timer and Attempts: Players must complete the game within a given time and limited attempts.
- Restart and Pause: The game can be paused, and players can restart at any time.

## Installation 
Prerequisites

   - Unity 2020.3+ (or any compatible version).

## How To Play
1. The player flips two cards by clicking on them.
   
2. If the terms and definitions match, the cards turn green, remain flipped, and are disabled.
   
3. If the cards do not match, they turn red for a second, then flip back around.
   
4. The player wins by matching all terms and definitions before the timer runs out or they run out of attempts.
